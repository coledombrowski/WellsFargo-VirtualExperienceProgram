Create a class for each entity in your data model (these should be placed in the entities directory). Respect the following when implementing your data model:

Each entity must be annotated with the @Entity type, which can be found in the javax.persistence package.
Each id must be auto-generated.
Each instance variable must contain either a column or a relationship annotation.
Each class must contain a constructor which initializes all instance variables.
Each class must expose a getter and setter for each instance variable (no setter for the id field is required).
Lean on the existing entities (one has been provided for you) for hints on how to accomplish the above.
